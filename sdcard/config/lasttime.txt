# Emergency Time Fallback
#
# This file is AUTO-CREATED by the device to store the last known time
# Used as emergency fallback if M5.Rtc (BM8563) loses power and time becomes invalid
#
# DO NOT manually edit this file unless recovering from complete time loss
#
# Format: Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)
# Example: 1735689600 = 2025-01-01 00:00:00 UTC
#
# Time Source Priority:
# 1. M5.Rtc (BM8563) - Primary source with backup battery
# 2. NTP sync - Updates RTC when WiFi available
# 3. This file - Emergency fallback if RTC invalid (year < 2020)
# 4. Default (2025-01-01) - Last resort
#
# This file will be automatically created on first boot with valid time.
# If you need to manually set the time, enter a Unix timestamp below:
#
# You can get current Unix timestamp from: https://www.unixtimestamp.com/
#
# Device will read this file ONLY if M5.Rtc time is invalid (year < 2020)
