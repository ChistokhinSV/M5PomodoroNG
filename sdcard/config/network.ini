# M5 Pomodoro v2 - Network Configuration
#
# EDIT THIS FILE with your WiFi and AWS IoT settings
# This file should be placed at: /config/network.ini on your SD card
#
# Lines starting with # are comments (ignored)

[WiFi]
# Your WiFi network credentials
# REQUIRED: Edit these with your actual WiFi SSID and password
SSID=YourWiFiSSID
Password=YourWiFiPassword

# Optional fallback network (if primary WiFi unavailable)
# Uncomment and edit if you want a backup WiFi network
#SSID_Fallback=MobileHotspot
#Password_Fallback=FallbackPassword123

[MQTT]
# AWS IoT Core endpoint
# Find at: AWS Console > IoT Core > Settings > Device data endpoint
# Format: xxxxxxxxxxxxx-ats.iot.region.amazonaws.com
# REQUIRED for cloud sync: Replace with your actual endpoint
Broker=a3xxxxxxxxxx-ats.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Port=8883

# MQTT client ID (must be unique per device)
# Recommendation: Use m5-pomodoro-<last 6 hex of MAC address>
# You can find MAC address in serial monitor on boot
# Example: If MAC is 11:22:33:44:A1:B2, use m5-pomodoro-A1B2C3
ClientID=m5-pomodoro-XXXXXX

# MQTT keep-alive interval in seconds
KeepAlive=60

[Certificates]
# SSL/TLS certificate file paths (relative to SD card root)
# These files MUST exist for secure AWS IoT connection
# See config/certs/README.md for setup instructions
RootCA=/config/certs/AmazonRootCA1.pem
DeviceCert=/config/certs/device-certificate.pem.crt
PrivateKey=/config/certs/device-private.pem.key

[CloudSync]
# Enable or disable AWS IoT Device Shadow synchronization
# Set to false if you don't want cloud sync (device works offline)
Enabled=true

# Sync interval in minutes (how often to push statistics to cloud)
# Recommendations:
#   5 minutes = Performance mode (more frequent updates, more battery drain)
#   10 minutes = Balanced mode
#   30 minutes = Battery saver mode (less frequent updates, longer battery life)
SyncIntervalMin=5

[NTP]
# NTP server for time synchronization
# Used to update M5.Rtc (BM8563) when WiFi connects
# Default pool.ntp.org works worldwide
# You can use regional servers for faster sync:
#   time.nist.gov (USA)
#   time.google.com (Google)
#   pool.ntp.org (worldwide)
Server=pool.ntp.org

# Timezone offset in seconds from UTC
# Calculate: hours × 3600
# Examples:
#   0 = UTC
#   3600 = UTC+1 (CET - Central European Time)
#   7200 = UTC+2 (EET - Eastern European Time)
#   -18000 = UTC-5 (EST - Eastern Standard Time)
#   -21600 = UTC-6 (CST - Central Standard Time)
#   -25200 = UTC-7 (MST - Mountain Standard Time)
#   -28800 = UTC-8 (PST - Pacific Standard Time)
#   32400 = UTC+9 (JST - Japan Standard Time)
#   36000 = UTC+10 (AEST - Australian Eastern Standard Time)
#
# NOTE: This is a fixed offset, does not account for daylight saving time
# If your region uses DST, you'll need to update this twice a year
TimezoneOffset=0
